## Steps to Write a Song in The Sims 4

Writing a song in The Sims 4 requires a few simple steps. Here’s how you can get started:

1. **Level Up Your Sim's Skill**  
   To write a song, your Sim must first have a good level of musical skill. To do this, increase your Sim’s Guitar or Piano skill (depending on which instrument you want them to use for songwriting).

2. **Use the Computer or Instrument**  
   Once your Sim is skilled enough, they can either write lyrics or compose music on the piano, guitar, or a computer. Simply click on the instrument or the computer and look for the “Write Song” option.

3. **Choose the Genre and Mood**  
   Your Sim can write songs in various genres like pop, rock, and more. You can also influence the mood of the song based on your Sim's emotions, which makes for interesting songwriting experiences.

4. **Recording and Publishing**  
   After completing a song, your Sim can record it. You can have your Sim publish the song and possibly even make money from it, depending on their fame or career path.
